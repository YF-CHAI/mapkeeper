In order to configure the build, edit Makefile.config to point to the
location of your copy of thrift.  If you ran thrift's "make install",
the default (/usr/local) will likely work for you.  Otherwise, point
it at the top directory of the tarball after doing a "./configure ;
make" in the thrift directory.

Note that mapkeeper requires the Thrift C++ and Java bindings.
